          11.1. Personal data subjects may exercise the rights under these Rules by submitting a request for the exercise of the applicable right.
          11.2. Requests to exercise the rights of data subjects may be made in the following way:
            (i) By electronic mail at the following email address: personaldata @ bg
            (ii) At the office of Sopharma
            (iii) By mail - at the address of the headquarters of Sopharma: Sofia. 1220, Nadezhda district, 16 Iliensko shose Str
          11.3. The request for the exercise of rights relating to the protection of personal data should contain the following information:
            (i) Identification of the person - name and personal identification number (where applicable)
            (ii) Feedback contacts - address, telephone, e-mail
            (iii) Request - description of the request and indication of how the response / correspondence on the request was received.
          11.4. Sopharma provides information on the actions taken in connection with a request for the exercise of the rights of the entities within one month of receipt of the request.
          11.5. If necessary, this period may be extended by a further two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests from a particular person. Sopharma shall inform the person of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, indicating the reasons for the delay.
          11.6. Sopharma does not owe any responses to requests in cases where the company is unable to identify the data subject.
          11.7. Sopharma may request the provision of additional information necessary to validate the identity of the data subject where there are reasonable concerns about the identity of the individual submitting the request.
          11.8. Where requests for the exercise of rights of the entities are manifestly unfounded or excessive, especially because of their repeatability, Sopharma may charge a reasonable fee on the basis of the administrative costs of providing the information or refuse to respond to the request for the exercise of rights. Sopharma assesses on a case-by-case basis whether a claim is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
          11.9. Excessive due account will be taken of all data subjects' personal data requests that have already been fully satisfied or which largely overlap with already satisfied requests regardless of the periods and time intervals elapsed between the individual requests unless there has been a change in the data or other processing parameters after the first request has been satisfied. For example, if a request is satisfied and a new request for exercise of the same right followed, no new  information has been received in the meantime and no additional personal data are processed by the entity, the request will be considered excessive due to its repeatability. In such cases Sopharma may refuse to respond to the request or to charge a reasonable fee,
          11.10. In case of refusal to provide access to personal data, Sopharma argues its refusal and informs the data subject about his right to file a complaint with the Personal Data Protection Commission (CPDP).
          11.11. Where the request is made by electronic means, the information shall, if possible, be provided by electronic means, unless the data subject has requested otherwise.
          11.12. These policies may be updated periodically to reflect changes in privacy practices of individuals whose data are processed by Sopharma.
          11.12. These rules come into force on 25.05.2018.`,
